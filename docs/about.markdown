Hi, I’m Moussa Kamal Eddine, a Lebanese NLP researcher currently working at [Zaion](https://zaion.ai/). My academic journey began after graduating from high school in 2013. I pursued a degree in Telecommunication and Software Engineering at the Lebanese University, where I studied for four years. During this time, I also earned a Bachelor's degree in Arabic Language and Literature from the same institution.

In 2017, I moved to France to further my education at the "Grande École," Telecom Paris, where I majored in Data Science, obtaining my engineering diploma in 2019. Following this, I embarked on a three-year PhD journey at École Polytechnique, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I successfully defended my thesis in 2022.

Currently, I continue my research in NLP at Zaion, where I am passionate about advancing the field. Through this blog, I aim to share my weekly research findings with the community, hoping they contribute to the collective knowledge and drive innovation in our area of expertise.

Outside of work, I enjoy taking care of my family, staying active through various sports, and spending time with friends. I hope you find my posts insightful and beneficial!
